            Basics of the game
Cricket is a team sport played by two competing sides usually formed of 11 players each. However, even If it’s just you and your mate in the park, you can still indulge in a game! You can play cricket anywhere – in the park, your garden, the street, the beach, a car park. The opportunities are endless
If you play club cricket, you will usually play at a cricket ground. A cricket ground is a large expanse of flat grass, quite often circular or oval in shape and surrounded by a boundary marker<br><br>
The pitch is situated in the middle of the field
A coin toss decides the order in which the teams bat and field. The two team captains contest the toss with the winning captain choosing whether to bat or field first
Both teams take turns batting and fielding<br><br>
Players on the batting side bat in pairs, with one situated at each end of the wicket
Wicket can refer to either the 22 yards between the stumps, the stumps themselves (with bails included) or a batsman’s dismissal from the game
Stumps are comprised of three upright wooden posts placed side by side in the ground, with two smaller sticks laid horizontally on top of the posts called bails to form the wicket<br><br>
Players on the batting side score runs by running between the wickets
International teams play Twenty20 cricket, one-day fixtures and Test matches
Twenty20 and one-day matches are formed of limited overs. As the name suggests, teams playing a Twenty20 game bat for a total of 20 overs each, while in one-day cricket, the total number of overs each side bats for is 50.<br><br>
Teams bat until they’ve either completed their overs or ten of their batsmen have been dismissed by the fielding side<br><br>
An over consists of six balls (deliveries) by a bowler from the fielding team
The team with the highest number of runs at the end wins!
