                    Sports Necessity: Sports play a vital role in society, serving as a necessity for individuals of all ages. Engaging in sports activities promotes physical fitness, mental well-being, and overall personal development. From a young age, participation in sports helps children develop essential motor skills, discipline, teamwork, and social interaction. For adults, sports provide a means to maintain a healthy lifestyle, manage stress, and foster camaraderie. Moreover, sports contribute to the economic growth of communities through the development of sports facilities, hosting events, and generating revenue. The necessity of sports goes beyond recreation; it positively impacts individuals, communities, and society as a whole.

                    <h3><u>--RESPONSIBILITIES--</u></h3><br>
                    <p2>
                    Sports Responsibility: With the immense influence and popularity of sports, there comes a significant responsibility to ensure fair play, integrity, and inclusivity. Sports organizations, athletes, coaches, and fans bear the responsibility to uphold ethical standards and values. This includes promoting equality, respect, and sportsmanship, both on and off the field. Additionally, it is essential to prioritize the safety and well-being of athletes by implementing appropriate training protocols, injury prevention measures, and fair competition rules. Sports also carry a societal responsibility to address issues such as doping, discrimination, and corruption, actively working towards creating a level playing field for all participants. By embracing this responsibility, sports can serve as a powerful platform for unity, inspiration, and positive societal change.

        <h1 align="center">ABOUT</h1>
        <p3><center>Every sports coaching institute, across the divisions are to be affiliated with this website to govern the players and maintain  communication throughout the sports industry at ease. 
            Teams can register themselves in this portal very easily.
            Since it is difficult to incorporate video cameras in lower division games, we track the post-game performances. This data is made available to the public.
            However, this post-match performances are reviewed by various coaches. Points based system have been engaged to track player rating, both coaches and public can count in, where points given by coaches count more valuable. By this we maintain transparency between the coaching industry and the public.
            These players are segregated according to their playing divisions. Ex- zonals, district, state, 1st division, 2nd division etc.
            We maintain a leader board across the divisions so there is clarity amongst the players and a healthy competition is maintained.
