       <h3>How to Hold the Cricket Bat</h3>

        <h3>Spin Bowling Drills</h3>
        <p>Begin by practicing your grip and release without bowling at full pace.
            Hold the ball with the appropriate grip for your chosen spin (e.g., off-spin, leg-spin, or finger spin).
            Focus on a smooth and controlled release, aiming to impart spin on the ball.
            Repeat this drill to develop muscle memory and consistency in your grip and release.</p>

      <div class="tutorial">
        <h3>Catching Techniques</h3>
        <p>Start with the basic catching technique. Stand with your knees slightly bent, hands relaxed and positioned in front of your body, fingers pointing upwards.
            As the ball approaches, keep your eyes focused on it, move your feet into position, and cup your hands to receive the ball.
            Practice catching from different angles and heights to simulate game situations.</p>

        <h3>Ground Fielding Drills</h3>
        <p>Practice fielding ground balls by rolling or throwing a ball towards you at different speeds and angles.
            Get down low with bent knees and a wide base to improve your balance and stability.
            Use your hands and body to stop the ball and quickly transfer it to your throwing hand.</p>
